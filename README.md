- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to install NodeJS and create a NextJS and Tailwind project, what are packages and how to install it.
I also learned to use Tailwind and familiarized with Node and NextJS


### Continued development

I want to keep improving my Tailwind skills and NextJS. I want to be able to use more components so my websites would be easier to maintain

### Useful resources

- [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - It helped me with the project creation and structure mainly.
